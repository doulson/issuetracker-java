In Spring, the @Bean annotation is used to indicate that a method returns an object that should be registered as a bean in the Spring ApplicationContext (the Spring container). Hereâ€™s why it's important to use @Bean:

Dependency Injection: It allows the Spring framework to manage the bean's lifecycle, making it available to other components via dependency injection. This simplifies the code and improves modularity.
Configuration Management: Spring beans configured with @Bean can have their properties easily set up or overridden. This can be helpful in multiple environments (e.g., development vs. production).
Customization: You can configure or customize the objects when defining them via Java configuration, giving you flexibility with the instantiation process. For instance, setting properties, applying filters, or adding additional behaviors.
Explicit Configuration: Using the @Bean annotation allows you to explicitly declare the Spring beans and dependencies that you want in your application, making the configuration more readable and testable.
Alternative to XML: It serves as an alternative to the older XML configuration, allowing you to define your application's configuration directly in Java code.


In the case of the PasswordEncoder example you provided:

By annotating the method with @Bean, the BCryptPasswordEncoder instance becomes a managed bean.
Other Spring-managed components can then automatically obtain this instance by injecting the PasswordEncoder type, helping standardize password encoding across your application.
