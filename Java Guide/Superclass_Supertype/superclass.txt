A superclass or supertype in object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a class or type from which other classes inherit.
A class that provides properties and methods to its subclasses via inheritance.
Superclass:
1. Also known as the base class or parent class.
2. It is the class that contains the common characteristics (properties, methods) that are shared across multiple derived classes (subclasses).
3. Subclasses inherit attributes and behaviors from the superclass, which promotes code reuse.


// Superclass
public class Animal {
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food");
    }
}

// Subclass
// use extends to link Animal Class
public class Dog extends Animal {
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.eat();  // Inherited from Animal (superclass)
        myDog.bark(); // Specific to Dog (subclass)
    }
}
