Supertype:
1. A more general concept that refers to a broader type in a type hierarchy.
2. It may include interfaces or abstract classes that other types (subtypes) implement or extend.

A more general concept that includes both superclasses and interfaces.
It represents the relationship between broader types and their more specific subtypes.

Example:
In this example, Vehicle is a supertype (an interface), and Car and Truck are subtypes implementing Vehicle.

// Supertype (interface)
public interface Vehicle {
    void drive();
}

// Subtype (implements the supertype)
public class Car implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("The car drives");
    }
}

// Another subtype
public class Truck implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("The truck drives");
    }
}
