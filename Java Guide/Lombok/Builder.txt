@SuperBuilder and @Builder are annotations provided by Lombok that can be used to automatically generate builder classes for your Java classes. The main difference between them is the way they handle inheritance.

1.  @Builder: This annotation generates a builder class that only includes the fields from the class where
    @Builder is applied. If your class inherits fields from a superclass and you want those fields to be included in the
    builder, you need to manually include them using the @Builder.Default annotation or by explicitly defining a
    method in the builder class to set those fields.

    Example:

    @Builder
    public class BaseClass {
        private String baseField;
    }

    @Builder
    public class ChildClass extends BaseClass {
        private String childField;
    }
