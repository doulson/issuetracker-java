Lombok is a popular library for Java that helps reduce boilerplate code in Java classes
by providing annotations to automatically generate commonly used methods such as getters, setters, constructors, and more.

Here are some key features of Lombok:

1.Reducing Boilerplate Code: Lombok annotations eliminate the need to write repetitive and verbose code,
                             such as getter and setter methods, constructors, equals(), hashCode(), and toString() methods.

2.Annotation-Based: Lombok works based on annotations that you include in your Java classes.
                    These annotations instruct Lombok to generate the corresponding code during compilation.

3.Compile-Time Processing: Lombok operates during the compilation process. When you compile your Java code,
                         Lombok's annotation processors run and generate the additional code specified by the annotations.

4.Integration with IDEs: Lombok seamlessly integrates with popular Java IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and NetBeans.
                         IDE plugins are available to provide syntax highlighting, code completion, and other features for Lombok annotations.

5.Active Community: Lombok has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development,
                    provide support, and share best practices for using Lombok effectively.

6. Support for Various Annotations: Lombok provides a variety of annotations for different use cases,
                                    including @Getter, @Setter, @ToString, @EqualsAndHashCode,
                                    @NoArgsConstructor, @AllArgsConstructor, and more.

Overall, Lombok is a valuable tool for Java developers to improve code readability, reduce verbosity,
and increase productivity by automating the generation of common boilerplate code in Java classes.
