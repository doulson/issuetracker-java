@RequiredArgsConstructor is an annotation provided by the Lombok library in Java.
When you annotate a class with @RequiredArgsConstructor,
Lombok generates a constructor for that class which initializes all final fields as arguments.
This annotation helps reduce boilerplate code in your classes.

Here's an example to illustrate how @RequiredArgsConstructor works:

import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;

@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class MyClass {
    private final String name;
    private final int age;
}
