UserDetailsService Interface: In Spring Security, UserDetailsService is an interface
that provides a method to load user data (such as username, password, and authorities) based on a given username.
This is generally used for authentication purposes.
The implementation of UserDetailsService can then be used to provide custom authentication logic.

Key Benefits:
Immutability:
Using private final ensures that the service is set only once,
preventing accidental modification and enhancing thread safety.

Dependency Injection:
By using constructor injection and final,
the dependency is guaranteed to be provided at runtime, which improves testability and reduces errors.

This pattern helps maintain a clean separation between
the business logic of user data retrieval and the security configuration that relies on it.
