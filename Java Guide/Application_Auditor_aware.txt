In Java Spring, AuditorAware is an interface used to determine the current auditor of an entity.
Auditing in this context typically refers to tracking information such as who created or last modified an entity,
and when. The AuditorAware interface provides a way to dynamically determine the current auditor,
which could be a user ID, username, or any other identifier.

The purpose of AuditorAware is to allow applications to customize how they determine the current auditor based on
their specific requirements. For example, an application might determine the current auditor based on the logged-in user,
a session variable, or some other context.
